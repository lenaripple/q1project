## Project Description
Weather to Adventure is a web app suggests weekend activities to people based on their location and local weather forecast.  

Users simply select their location from a pre-populated list and select their desired date, and then receive activity suggestions.  For example: if it is going to snow, they should go skiing.  If rain, the web app will suggest a local brewery.  If sunny, it will suggest a hike nearby.  Brewery and ski resort recommendations are randomly generated based on the location.  Hikes are pre-populated also based on location, but will not be randomized.
